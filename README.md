## Webpage using SVG Animation.
#I have created webpage using HTML and CSS. In the center there is a circle, which I have created using SVG. On this circle's border you can see some dots at some interval. 
When i click on any dot, you can see another border is coming and it is moving from one dot to another dot. This border animation is done using SVG animation. Content inside this circle and background image is also changing when we click on next dot.
